# OpenSCAD-Compendium
Constructive Solid Geometry CAD/CAM Component Base Designed for Fast Development

World War III is coming, and the time and space for preparation for democracies is running out.

Here is the introductory video for a world that forgot World Wars for 80 years...

At the same time, World War is the single biggest spending impulse known to human history and the precise moment when the people with the most to lose - the soldiers, sailors, and air people - need the help of three groups of organizations the most (engineering, manufacturing, and logistics). 

If you haven't been watching the increasing rapid lethality of modern battlefields - especially those approaching megacities urban complexity and population density - then you would not appreciate just how dire those people will face. Especially those that start WWIII, they will have the least technology and they will be at gravest harm.

We don't have time for disorganization even as every democracy has left us this way. 

We need to build a system that allows anyone to take on research, development, and deployment of military-application systems that can be generated everywhere, anytime. Building systems in a megacity at war is what the Asian nations will discover grimly, very soon. 
We need a system where people can design parts and send them to the front, and collaborate with a common starting point without knowing or speaking the same language or living next door.

I have been dreaming up, architecting, skeletonizing then delivering military systems for 20+ years and there has never been a concerted target effort to make this easy to adopt. 

Military systems are hard because the requirements are the most intense out there, and it doesn't help when projects start largely from scratch, as nascent solo efforts. 

What the West needs is a common starting point - free to use, free to adapt, free to expand - that allows anyone to insert their niche skills in ways that help people that they will never know and never meet. 


There is a lot of good code out there, and places for resources like BRL-CAD and others for the use of all. But designing the design of the design is something few people have time to spin up in a hurry.

#Compendium Development Plan:

Phase 1: Amassing - the goal is to bring together all the code source files that can be found for the purpose of unified consideration. We need to bring everything together in one place so as to understand what's in and what's missing.
Phase 2: Commonizing - the goal is to adjust to a common nomenclature, common units, and common symbols so as to make learning, using and expanding so as to allow the most people to 
Phase 3: Documenting - the goal is to bring everything under this ontolog into a commonized documentation system. From a cursory review of Belfry and openscad-amu, I've picked openscad-amu but it should admit many systems. Here is where internationalization and multi-language localization takes place. 
Phase 4: Expanding - the best library system is the one that allows one to build from the ground up through common features 
Phase 5: Assimilating - once everything has a common form and format, bring in extras like BRL-CAD to expand what can be done and where this applies.
